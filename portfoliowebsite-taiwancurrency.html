            <h2>Taiwanese Currency Redesign</h2>
            <p>History repeatedly shows the country of Taiwan as a colonized nation, with the world yet confusing Taiwan as either an independent state or purely an extension of China. This Taiwanese currency redesign targets Taiwanese citizens and residents to gain more pride in their country by celebrating Taiwan's beauty and history as an independent country. The project also targets people abroad, allowing them to see that Taiwan is the center of great technological innovation, as well as of art, nature, and life. Despite its complicated history and continued controversy, Taiwan is independently a country full of character and uniqueness.</p>
